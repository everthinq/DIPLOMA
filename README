These projects needs to forecasting temperature with WEKA.

First thing you'll need to do is install WEKA. WEKA using machine learning algorithms for train forecasting models. You can find WEKA installer (for Windows) in intall folder. WEKA written in Java and thats why WEKA needs Java Virtual Machine.

Second thing is parsing "real" weather data from gismeteo using gismeteo_parser written in scrapy asynchronous framework. For "real" weather data you'll need to run main.py in gismeteo_parser at 23:30PM until 23:55PM. Also you need to stash your weather data for couple of days\moths\years for making more accurate temperature forecast.

Third thing is running gui.pyw from GUI_project which makes *.ARFF files for WEKA. This file needs for the temperature forecasting. You'll need to choose city; daypart of forecasting (night, morning, day or evening); start_date and end_date. GUI has a parameters by default, but you can choose another if you want.

Fourth thing is forecasting with WEKA. 
You need to open WEKA and install forecast package. Then go for the forecast tab, check temp attribute, set number of days for forecast and click start and WEKA returns dates with forecasted temperature. 

There is a gismeteo.db file in database folder with Moldova weather data from 2017-03-10 until 2017-06-28.

You can find more README files in gismeteo_parser and GUI_project folders.
