Using scrapy framework for m.gismeteo.com parsing

This code parses weather from all Moldova cities (e.g. http://m.gismeteo.com/weather/14490/detailday/)

gismeteo_parser needs (if your OS is Windows):
python-2.7.13.msi
lxml-3.5.0.win32-py2.7.exe
Twisted-15.0.0.win32-py2.7.msi
pip install scrapy
pip install pypiwin32

Then you need to run main.py in gismeteo_parser folder and parser starts downloading the Moldova cities weather. After that pipelines.py creates a database folder and gismeteo.db file with data in it. You can open gismeteo.db if you'll install DB Browser for SQLite.

Moldova can be easily replaced by another country. You need to go in gismeteo_spider.py and change URL in start_urls array (e.g. for Russia: start_urls = ['http://m.gismeteo.com/citysearch/districts/156/'])

After changing start_urls array you can run main.py and get cities weather from another country.
